/**
 * #### Introduction
 *
 * The Byte Stream API enables a client to read and write a stream of bytes to
 * and from a resource. Resources have names, and these names are supplied in
 * the API calls below to identify the resource that is being read from or
 * written to.
 *
 * All implementations of the Byte Stream API export the interface defined here:
 *
 * * `Read()`: Reads the contents of a resource.
 *
 * * `Write()`: Writes the contents of a resource. The client can call `Write()`
 *   multiple times with the same resource and can check the status of the write
 *   by calling `QueryWriteStatus()`.
 *
 * #### Service parameters and metadata
 *
 * The ByteStream API provides no direct way to access/modify any metadata
 * associated with the resource.
 *
 * #### Errors
 *
 * The errors returned by the service are in the Google canonical error space.
 *
 * @generated from service google.bytestream.ByteStream

   *
   * A `Write()` action is resumable. If there is an error or the connection is
   * broken during the `Write()`, the client should check the status of the
   * `Write()` by calling `QueryWriteStatus()` and continue writing from the
   * returned `committed_size`. This may be less than the amount of data the

   * a `WriteResponse`. The service will not view the resource as `complete`
