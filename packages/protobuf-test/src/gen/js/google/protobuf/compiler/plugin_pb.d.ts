// WARNING:  The plugin interface is currently EXPERIMENTAL and is subject to

//
// protoc (aka the Protocol Compiler) can be extended via plugins.  A plugin is
// just a program that reads a CodeGeneratorRequest from stdin and writes a
// CodeGeneratorResponse to stdout.
//
// Plugins written using C++ can use google/protobuf/compiler/plugin.h instead
// of dealing with the raw protocol defined here.
//
// A plugin executable needs only to be placed somewhere in the path.  The
// plugin should be named "protoc-gen-$NAME", and will then be used when the
// flag "--${NAME}_out" is passed to protoc.

   * produced by another code generator.  The original generator may provide
   * insertion points by placing special annotations in the file that look
   * like:
   *   @@protoc_insertion_point(NAME)
   * The annotation can have arbitrary text before and after it on the line,
   * which allows it to be placed in a comment.  NAME should be replaced with
   * an identifier naming the point -- this is what other generators will use
   * as the insertion_point.  Code inserted at this point will be placed
   * immediately above the line containing the insertion point (thus multiple
   * insertions to the same point will come out in the order they were added).
   * The double-@ is intended to make it unlikely that the generated code
   * could contain things that look like insertion points by accident.
   *
   * For example, the C++ code generator places the following line in the
   * .pb.h files that it generates:
   *   // @@protoc_insertion_point(namespace_scope)
   * This line appears within the scope of the file's package namespace, but
   * outside of any particular class.  Another plugin can then specify the
   * insertion_point "namespace_scope" to generate additional classes or
   * other declarations that should be placed in this scope.
   *
   * Note that if the line containing the insertion point begins with
   * whitespace, the same whitespace will be added to every line of the
   * inserted text.  This is useful for languages like Python, where
   * indentation matters.  In these languages, the insertion point comment
   * should be indented the same amount as any inserted code will need to be
   * in order to work correctly in that context.
   *
   * The code generator that generates the initial file and the one which
   * inserts into it must both run as part of a single invocation of protoc.
   * Code generators are executed in the order in which they appear on the
   * command line.
   *
   * If |insertion_point| is present, |name| must also be present.
